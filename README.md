# odin-recipes

This is the recipe website project in "The Odin Project"

  This site will have a main index page and links out to a few recipes. There 
will be no styling on the original build because this is purely an HTML project. CSS will be added at a later time to clean it up and make it look good.

  Skills - Basic HTML with links and multiple pages and images. Ordered and
Unordered lists will be used to layout the steps of each recipe. A link to the
Odin Project About Page will also be present to link end users with the course 
used to create this page.
