  <h1>Texas Style Brisket</h1>

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Brisket is a Texas tradition. There is something magical about taking a large tough cut of meat and slow smoking it 
    to perfection and then slicing it up and watch all the juices just run everywhere. This is one of my favorite cuts to 
    cook, as long as I have the time.

        <li>Coarse Pepper</li>

        <li>BBQ Sauce of choice for serving</li>            
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Prep</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Trim Fat cap down to about 1/4" and coat with mustard.</li>
    <li>Liberally apply the seasonings starting with the coarse black pepper. Its ok to be heavy handed here.</li>
    <li>Allow the brisket to set covered on the counter for about an hour to come to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Fire up your smoker to 225F and let it stabilize. You want a good blue colored smoke.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Cook</h3>
  <ol>  
    <li>Put the Brisket on the smoker fat side up and let it smoke for 1 hour per pound.</li>
    <li>Once the Brisket reaches 165F, tightly wrap in butcher paper and raise temp to 250F</li>
    <li>Allow to cook until internal temperature reaches about 205F. This will break down the connective tissues inside the muscle.</li>
    <li>Remove wrapped brisket from smoker adn wrap in clear plastic wrap over the butcher paper to seal in the juices.</li>
    <li>Place the brisket in a cooler and allow to rest for at leat an hour.</li>
    <li>Slice, serve and enjoy your delicous brisket!</li>
  </ol>
